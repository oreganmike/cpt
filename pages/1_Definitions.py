Model selection isn't that significant. For now it just allows for cost per token values to be pre-set.

This includes:
- Tokens from the user's question/input
- Tokens from the model's response

**Typical values**:
- Short exchanges: 200-400 tokens
- Medium exchanges: 400-800 tokens
- Long, detailed exchanges: 800+ tokens

**Example**:
- User question: "What are the council tax bands?" (7 tokens)
- Model response with detailed explanation (293 tokens)
- Total = 300 tokens per turn

**Note**:
- Backend RAG-related token generation isn't included e.g. generating embeddings, question parsing, generating queries, CoT, etc.

st.markdown(
    """
The final cost estimate follows this calculation process:

1. **Calculate Engaged Users**:
    ```
    Council Population Ã— Conversion Rate Ã— Engagement Rate
    ```

2. **Calculate Total Conversations**:
    ```
    Engaged Users Ã— Conversations per User
    ```

3. **Calculate Total Tokens**:
    ```
    Total Conversations Ã— Turns per Conversation Ã— Tokens per Turn
    ```

4. **Calculate Final Cost**:
    ```
    Total Tokens Ã— Cost per Token
